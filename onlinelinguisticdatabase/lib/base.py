        being used to control the session and app_globals from within tests.
        
        If present, environ['test.authentication.role'] will evaluate to a user
        role that can be used to retrieve a user with that role from the db and
        put it in the (Beaker) session.  This permits simulation of
        authentication and authorization. See https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/pylons-discuss/test$20session/pylons-discuss/wiwOQBIxDw8/0yR3z3YiYzYJ
        for the origin of this hack.

        If present, setting environ['test.application_settings'] to a truthy
        value will result in app_globals.application_settings being set to an
        ApplicationSettings instance.  This permits simulation of the
        application settings cache in app_globals which is used for
        inventory-based validation.  One issue with this approach is that the
        app_globals.application_settings attribute is not unset after the test is
        run.  Therefore, the __after__ method (see below) deletes the attribute
        when environ['test.application_settings'] is truthy.

        WARNING: overwriting __before__ (or __after__) in a controller class
        (without calling their super methods) will cause nosetests to fail en
        masse.
